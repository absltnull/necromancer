# necromancer

necromancer is an Android app made in Flutter to find, resurrect and restore old Android apps. it uses a simple Python-based backend which runs on a single script. the main goal of this project was just a hobby and an idea which turned into my first ever GitHub repo. enjoy building or modifying the app from source. I'll be adding the actual releases soon.
